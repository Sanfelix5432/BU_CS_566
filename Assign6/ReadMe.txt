User should prepare their own csv file, copy their file link and paste it in 
the code:with open('/Users/felix/Desktop/package.csv', newline='') as csvfile.
(Replace /Users/felix/Desktop/package.csv )
The input file should follow the following from package_number,state,city
Do not enter any space.And aslo,the package wll depart from the Boston. 
The output will be pretty long, if user just want to know the the ordered list
based on the priority,user can delete all the print code except :
print(f"Package {package_priority[0]}: {package_priority[1]}")
